# CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science
This repository contains my solutions for the problem sets of the CS50 course offered by Harvard University. CS50 is an introductory course in computer science that covers topics such as algorithms, data structures, programming languages, software engineering, and web development.

## Problem Sets
The problem sets are assignments that are part of the course and cover various topics related to computer science. Each problem set is divided into several parts, and the solutions for each part are written in C, Python, or another programming language.

The problem sets are organized into directories named pset1, pset2, pset3, etc., and each directory contains the source code files for the corresponding problem set.

## How to Use
To use this repository, you can simply clone the repository or download the source code files for the problem sets that you are interested in. You can then compile and run the programs to test the solutions.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Harvard University for offering this amazing course, and the CS50 team for creating the problem sets and providing the necessary resources for completing them.
